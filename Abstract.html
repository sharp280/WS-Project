        Miyamura have a son named Kyohei Miyamura (宮村京平 Miyamura Kyōhei). Izumi is the only child in the family. The
        apartment number where Izumi lives with her mother is 704.</p>
    <p class="text-vnuk">When he was 5 years old, Shin was able to capture the Hollow Bird and the Forest Rabbit using
        the
        "Vacuum Wave" magic. Returning home, Shin greets his grandfather and his grandfather's acquaintances Melinda and
        Michel. After telling them about his latest animal hunts, they were amazed by his ability, and Michelle Collins,
